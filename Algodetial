The player finally decides to run at x + x_delta when he sees the curve to x

The odds
(1x3 / (3x6) 

Conditional probability

=
]
=
1- x_delta/(1- x)

Conditions for EV value
=
Probability * conditional probability
=
0.99/[1- ] 
=

EV value = conditional EV value * the probability that the player sees x
=
0.99 / [1 - (x + x_delta)] * [1 - x_delta/(1 - x)] * (1 - x)
=
0.99/(1-x-x_delta) * (1-x-x_delta)
=
0.99
